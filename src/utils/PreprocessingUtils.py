  The preprocessing function that takes in a set of RDF triples
  and converts that into the graph dataset we will be using for
  our models using the Role based processing scheme.
  It loads the input from the disk, and iterates through each line
  of RDF triples

  ex - Let the triple set be
  " Dwarak | Loves | Physics <TSP> Dwarak | lives_in | India "
  There could be sets from one to seven triples.
  We intially extract each triple and create a triple list.
  triple 1 = Dwarak | loves | physics
  triple 2 = Dwaral | lives_in | India

  We create a Networkx Multi-Di graph objet with the subject
  and predicate of the triple as nodes and the predicate as
  the edge. After doing this for all the triples in the triple
  list, we can get the adjacency matrix of the graph as a numpy
  array. We also give each node a role.
  Subject - appears on the left side of the triple
  Object - appears on the right side of the triple
  Bridge - appears on both sides
  Predicate - forms an edge between nodes.

  This way we impart the structural information of the triple set
  into the models inputs.
